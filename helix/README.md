Things I'd definitely miss in Helix:
* Git stuff
    * No "show hunk changes" equivalent
    * No "throw out hunk changes" equivalent
    * Doesn't seem to automatically refresh diff gutter after commit
* No plugin system yet
    * https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/discussions/3806
    * Can't port my "Open all modified/staged files" action
* No autocomplete without LSP
    * https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/3328

Things I'd maybe get used to in Helix:
* Selecting next instance of word under cursor
    * `cmd+d` in ST = `be*vn` in Helix
* Duplicating line
    * `cmd+shift+d` in ST = `Xyp` in Helix
* buffers instead of tabs
    * `ga` to toggle between two recent buffers
    * `:bc` to close buffer
    * `<space>b` to choose buffer
* no access to cmd
    * https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2913
* move lines or blocks up/down
    * https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2245
* trailing spaces
    * https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/2719
    * currently have to show all spaces
* Open multiple files at once
* Scrolling left/right with trackpad
