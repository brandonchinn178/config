# Sublime Text

## Packages

After installing Package Control, I use the following packages:

- GitGutter
- Maybs Quit
- Monokai Pro
- Six
- TrailingSpaces

## Preferences

Since Sublime Text configurations are configurable through the app, it's weird to version control, since saving from `Sublime Text > Preferences > Settings` would change the git repository elsewhere.

This directory contains files that should go under `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/`.
